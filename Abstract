Accurate identification of cattle breeds is essential for effective livestock management, genetic conservation, dairy productivity, and breeding programs. In India, where a large number of indigenous bovine breeds exist, manual breed identification relies heavily on expert knowledge and visual inspection, which can be time-consuming, subjective, and error-prone. To address this challenge, this project presents an automated cattle breed classification system based on Deep Learning and Computer Vision techniques.

The proposed system uses a convolutional neural network–based image classification approach to identify Indian cattle breeds from photographic images. A structured dataset containing labeled images across multiple cattle breeds is used to train the model. Image preprocessing and data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, zooming, and normalization are applied to improve model generalization and robustness. Transfer learning with a pretrained EfficientNetV2 architecture is employed to leverage previously learned visual features and improve performance on limited data. The model is further optimized using fine-tuning, regularization, and early stopping strategies.

The trained model is evaluated using validation accuracy, precision, recall,  and confusion matrix analysis to measure classification performance across all breed categories. In addition to the core model, a user-friendly prediction interface is developed using Gradio, enabling users to upload cattle images and receive real-time breed predictions along with confidence scores. This makes the system accessible to non-technical users such as farmers, students, and livestock officers.

The solution demonstrates how artificial intelligence can support digital transformation in agriculture by providing a fast, consistent, and scalable breed identification tool. With further dataset expansion and model refinement, the system can be extended into a field-ready application for smart livestock management, breed conservation programs, and dairy industry support.
