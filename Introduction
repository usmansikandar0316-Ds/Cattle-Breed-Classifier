Pakistan has one of the largest and most diverse cattle populations in the world, with more than 50 recognized indigenous bovine breeds. These breeds differ in physical characteristics, productivity, disease resistance, and adaptability to climate. Correct identification of cattle breeds is essential for breeding programs, dairy management, conservation of indigenous breeds, veterinary diagnosis, and government livestock schemes.
Traditionally, cattle breed identification is performed manually by veterinarians or livestock experts based on physical traits such as body structure, horn shape, coat color, and size. This manual approach is time-consuming, subjective, and requires expert knowledge, which is often unavailable in rural areas. As a result, breed misidentification can lead to poor breeding decisions, reduced milk productivity, and loss of genetic diversity.
With the rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Computer Vision, automated image-based breed classification has become feasible. Deep Learning models, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have demonstrated strong performance in image recognition tasks. By training such models on labeled images of cattle breeds, it is possible to build an automated system that predicts the breed from a photograph.
This project focuses on developing an Automated Pakistan Cattle Breed Classification System using Deep Learning. The system takes an image of a cow as input and predicts its breed using a trained neural network model. A user-friendly web-based interface is also developed using Gradio, allowing easy interaction with the model for real-world testing and demonstrations.
The project aims to contribute toward digital transformation in agriculture and livestock management by providing a low-cost, scalable, and accessible breed identification tool.
