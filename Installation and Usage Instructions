# **Installation and Usage Instructions**

## **1. Overview**

This project implements an Indian Cattle Breed Classification system using Deep Learning and Computer Vision. The model is trained using TensorFlow in Google Colab and deployed through a browser-based prediction interface using Gradio. The following instructions describe how to install dependencies, prepare the dataset, train the model, and run the prediction interface so that other users can reproduce the results.

The project can be reproduced using **Google Colab Free Version**, which is recommended because it provides free GPU access and preinstalled ML libraries.

---

# **2. System Requirements**

The project can be reproduced using either of the following environments:

## Option A — Recommended

* Google Colab (Free)
* Google Drive storage
* Internet connection

## Option B — Local System

* Python 3.9 or later
* Minimum 8 GB RAM
* GPU recommended (optional but helpful)
* Windows / Linux / macOS

---

# **3. Required Python Libraries**

The following libraries are required:

* tensorflow
* numpy
* matplotlib
* scikit-learn
* opencv-python
* pillow
* gradio

---

## **4. Installation — Google Colab (Recommended Method)**

Open Google Colab and run:

```python
!pip install -q tensorflow opencv-python pillow scikit-learn gradio
```

Most packages are already preinstalled in Colab, but this ensures correct versions.

---

# **5. Dataset Preparation**

The dataset must be organized in a directory structure where each class (breed) has its own folder.

## Required Folder Structure

```
Indian_bovine_breeds/
    Breed_1/
        img1.jpg
        img2.jpg
    Breed_2/
        img1.jpg
        img2.jpg
    Breed_3/
        ...
```

Each folder name becomes the class label automatically.

---

## Upload Dataset to Colab

### Method A — Upload ZIP

```python
from google.colab import files
uploaded = files.upload()
```

Then unzip:

```python
!unzip Indian_bovine_breeds.zip
```

---

## Method B — Use Google Drive (Best for Large Dataset)

Mount drive:

```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

Set dataset path:

```python
DATA_DIR = "/content/drive/MyDrive/Indian_bovine_breeds"
```

---

# **6. Model Training Instructions**

Run the training script cell-by-cell in Colab.

Training includes:

1. Dataset loading
2. Data augmentation
3. Transfer learning model setup
4. Two-phase training (feature extraction + fine tuning)
5. Model checkpoint saving

The trained model will be saved as:

```
Best_Cattle_Breed.keras
```

Training time depends on:

* dataset size
* number of classes
* GPU availability

Typical training time on Colab GPU:

```
1–3 hours
```

---

# **7. Evaluation Instructions**

After training completes, the evaluation block automatically computes:

* Validation accuracy
* Classification report
* Precision / Recall / F1-score
* Confusion matrix visualization

No extra steps required — results print automatically.

---

# **8. Running the Prediction Interface**

The project includes a browser-based interface using Gradio.

## Run Interface Cell:

```python
import gradio as gr

gr.Interface(
    fn=predict_image,
    inputs=gr.Image(type="filepath"),
    outputs="label",
    title="Indian Cattle Breed Classifier"
).launch()
```

---

## How to Use Interface

1. Click upload image
2. Select cattle photo
3. Model predicts breed
4. Confidence score displayed
5. Runs directly in browser

No desktop GUI required.

---

# **9. Running Outside Colab (Local Machine)**

If running locally, install dependencies:

```bash
pip install tensorflow opencv-python pillow scikit-learn matplotlib gradio
```

Run training script:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

Run prediction app:

```bash
python app.py
```

---

# **10. Model File Requirement**

Prediction interface requires trained model file:

```
Best_Cattle_Breed.keras
```

Ensure this file is in the same directory as the prediction script or update the path:

```python
MODEL_PATH = "Best_Cattle_Breed.keras"
```

---

# **11. Common Issues and Fixes**

## Problem: Only one class detected

Cause: Dataset folder nesting incorrect
Fix: Ensure class folders are directly inside dataset root

---

## Problem: Low accuracy

Cause:

* Too many classes
* Too few images per class

Fix:

* Add more images
* Reduce class count
* Improve image quality

---

## Problem: GUI not opening in Colab

Cause: Tkinter not supported
Fix: Use Gradio interface instead (already provided)

---

# **12. Reproducibility Notes**

To reproduce similar results:

* Use same dataset structure
* Use same image size (224×224)
* Keep validation split at 0.2
* Use transfer learning with EfficientNet
* Enable data augmentation
* Use two-phase training
* Enable early stopping
